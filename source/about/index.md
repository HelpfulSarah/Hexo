# About Me

My name is Sarah and I try to be as helpful as can be. I'm a mom of 4, 2 little ones and 2 grown ones. I have 3 part-time jobs and now I'm also a blogger. I want to do anything and everything I can to stay home with my little girls as much as possible.
I really enjoy cooking and eating, cleaning up - not so much! I like to work from recipes. I've only just begun to stray from recipes and making my own concoctionns that actually taste good!
I struggle to call myself a gardener as I've only had a garden once and that was just this past Summer in 2018. I'm actually getting ready to start preparing for the upcoming Summer garden. I will be doing posts to go along with the process.
Mainly, I like to learn and I like to share that knowledge. I'm a huge believer in sharing the why and not just telling what to do. When you understand the why, the how seems to make more sense.
