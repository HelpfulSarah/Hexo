## Who exactly is Helpful Sarah?

My name is Sarah and I try to be as helpful as I can be. I am always trying to stay busy and I like to wear many hats and keep many irons in the fire, so to speak. 

## My Why

Let's start with my why, my main motivation in life! My 4 children are my world. I have 3 daughters and 1 son. They are 20, 19, 2.5 and 6 months old.

The oldest is moved out, a retail manager, and taking care of herself.

The 19 yo, my only son, is just getting started in the career that he's been talking about since he could talk.

The 2 and a half year old is super adorable but knows how to drive mommy crazy very well.

The 6 month old doesn't do a whole lot yet but she is so cute with her chubby little cheeks!

So I do have a large age gap between my 2 sets of kids. My little ones are what I call round 2 aka avoiding empty nest syndrome! Haha!

## My Work

So what kind of irons do I have going?

Well, I work for a janitorial company doing computer work, mostly from home.

I work for a retail company as a vendor rep in grocery stores as needed, usually a couple of times a month.

I'm an individual consultant for [Pampered Chef](https://www.pamperedchef.com/pws/sarahconrad/). When a purchase is made using my link or through a party that is hosted through me, I earn a minimum 22% commission. Commission totals go up as my monthly sales go up, up to 27%. If you're interested in hosting a party or joining my team, please email me at PCSarahConrad@gmail.com

I'm an affiliate with [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=helpfulsarah-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=43118217798056136784964e9fab78d0&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=hpc&keywords=Kitchen). When you purchase through my link, you still pay the same price you normally would, Amazon just gives me a very small percentage of that cost as a thank you for sending them some business, usually between 1 and 4%. I also have access to share [promo codes](https://amzn.to/2TSKCGo)! I'm debating on making a promo code page!

I'm and affiliate with [Cinchshare](https://www.cinchshare.com?a=cs4d5). This is a social media post sheduling software that I use to do my Pampered Chef posts on various platforms. I get one month free when anyone signs up and stays for 3 months. Don't forget to use promo code CinchFree to get your first 37 days free.

I'm an affiliate with [NameSilo](https://www.namesilo.com/register.php?rid=555a763gn). I get 10% commission on any purchase made with my link. This is where I bought my domain name from for very cheap! Use my promo code HelpfulSarah for a discount! 

I'm currently building a following on Pinterest. As of 2/18/19, I'm up to 15k monthly viewers. I started with around 50 viewers at the beginning of February!

And last, but not least, I'm working on this site, helpfulsarah.com, my first blog! I was determined to not pay a monthly hosting fee so I did some research. I use node.js on my laptop to build my website using a template from Hexo.io. I keep my files on github and publish and host my site for free on netlify.com.

## Thank you for learning about me!

If you would like to reach out to me, email me at HelpfulSarah@outlook.com.
