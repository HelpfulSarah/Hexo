<strong>One pot meals are all the rage! If you love Shrimp, you will love this dish! Delicious - combined with orzo, which is basically pasta posing as rice! Haha!</strong>

INGREDIENTS 

8 oz. (250 g) large frozen, thawed shrimp, peeled and deveined (31-40 per pound) 
1 tsp (5 mL) Lemon Pepper Rub 
1 tbsp (15 mL) canola oil 
1 small onion 
1 tbsp (15 mL) butter 
2 garlic cloves 
½ tsp (2 mL) salt 
1 cup (250 mL) orzo pasta 
1¾ cups (425 mL) low-sodium chicken broth 
½ cup (125 mL) frozen peas 
1 oz. (30 g) pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese 
1 lemon 
¼ cup (50 mL) fresh parsley leaves 


DIRECTIONS 

Season the shrimp with the rub. Heat the oil in the 10" (25-cm) [Stainless Steel Nonstick Skillet](https://www.pamperedchef.com/pws/sarahconrad/shop/Cookware/Cookware/10%22+Stainless+Steel+Nonstick+Skillet/2087) over medium-high heat for 3–5 minutes. Add the shrimp and sear for 2–3 minutes on each side, or until they’re lightly browned and pink. Remove the shrimp from the skillet. 

Cut the onion into chunks and chop with the [Food Chopper](https://www.pamperedchef.com/pws/sarahconrad/shop/Cooking+Tools/Fruit+%26+Vegetable+Tools/Food+Chopper/2585). 

Add the butter to the skillet and cook until it’s melted. Add the onion, garlic pressed with the [Garlic Press](https://www.pamperedchef.com/pws/sarahconrad/shop/Cooking+Tools/Herb+%26+Garlic/Garlic+Press/2576), and salt and saute for 1–2 minutes, or until the onion is translucent.
{% asset_img GarlicPress.jpg %}This Garlic Press is the best in the world! In my humble opinion, of course. Press garlic without even peeling it first. Use the tool to scoop the peel out so you don't get those sticky garlic fingers. Then use the bristle end that fits perfectly into all of the holes to easily clean it! 


Add the orzo to the skillet. Stir while the orzo is toasting, for about 2–3 minutes. 

When the orzo is browned, add the broth and peas. Simmer for 6–8 minutes, uncovered, or until the liquid is absorbed. (You can add more broth as needed if the orzo needs more time.) 

Grate the cheese with the [Microplane® Adjustable Fine Grater](https://www.pamperedchef.com/pws/sarahconrad/shop/Cooking+Tools/Graters%2C+Peelers+%26+Grinders/Microplane+Adjustable+Fine+Grater/1105). Juice the lemon into the skillet with the [Citrus Press](https://www.pamperedchef.com/pws/sarahconrad/shop/Cooking+Tools/Fruit+%26+Vegetable+Tools/Citrus+Press/2595). Add the shrimp and half of the cheese; stir. Remove the skillet from the heat. 

Use the [Herb Mill](https://www.pamperedchef.com/pws/sarahconrad/shop/Cooking+Tools/Fruit+%26+Vegetable+Tools/Herb+Mill/1524) to grate the parsley over the top of the skillet. Top with remaining cheese.

Cook's Tips: 
Toasting the orzo develops an unexpected nutty flavor and golden color. Searing the shrimp is such an easy and fast way to get great flavor, color and texture. These two techniques step up this simple weeknight meal.
