Star Fruit, or Carambola, is a fruit that is gaining popularity in the United States. There are sweet and tart varieties but they are hard to tell apart. 

The edges should be trimmed off but the peel is edible.

They are good for a few days at room temperature or up to two weeks in the refrigerator.

Check out the video of me and my 2 year old daughter trying out star fruit for the very first time!

Bottom line: It's not terrible!
