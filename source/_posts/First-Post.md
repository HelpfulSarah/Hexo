<h2>So what's this page all about anyway?</h2>
Let me start by introducing myself! My name is Sarah and I like to be helpful! I decided to start a blog because I really want to help everyone in the same way that I'm always looking for help. Anyone who knows me knows that if I don't know the answer off the top of my head, I will immediately turn to Google for an answer. I have a love of learning and of sharing the knowledge that I have gained.
<p>The main focuses in my life are my 4 kiddos and food- cooking, preparing, growing, eating... basically anything to do with food! So this blog will be mostly focused on food, though I'm not necessarily a foodie!
<p>In the Summer, I will have a garden with lots of yummy food. This past Summer was my first time having a garden. It was pretty successful, but it was definitely a learning process. Indoor seeding will begin soon.
<p>I will also be sharing recipes that I have made or will be making again. I will also be doing some How-To posts to share some knowledge about various (mostly food-related) topics!
<p>I hope you will follow me on one of my various social media pages to see my new posts as they come out and are shared for everyone to see!

Thank you!
